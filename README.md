# build-restful-apis-with-nodejs-and-express
This github (GH) repo provides code examples to demonstrate how to create a basic, RESTful web API with several JavaScript libraries. 

The example code will guide you through how to set up a NodeJS project, including a Express server, a testing environment, and creating the endpoints that are required to add, update, and delete data from a MongoDB database. 

Plus, examples on how to serve static files such as images with the new API - additional examples also to explore other libraries that can help streamline API development, such as Koa and LoopBack.
